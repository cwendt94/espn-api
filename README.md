# ff-espn-api

This package uses ESPN's Fantasy Football API to extract data from any public or private league. I am currently using this package for my leagues personal website and I plan to keep updating and adding features.

Please feel free to make suggestions, bug reports, and pull request for features or fixes!

This package was inspired and based off of [rbarton65/espnff](https://github.com/rbarton65/espnff).

## Installing
With Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/cwendt94/ff-espn-api
cd ff-espn-api
python3 setup.py install
```
With pip:
```
pip install ff_espn_api
```

## Usage
This will show you how to use `ff-espn-api` with private or public leagues

### Initial Start
Public League
```python
from ff_espn_api import League
league_id = 1234
year = 2018
league = League(league_id, year)
```
For private league you will need to get your swid and espn_s2.(Chrome Browser) You can find these two values after logging into
your espn fantasy football account on espn's website. Then right click anywhere on the website and click inspect
option. From there click Application on the top bar. On the left under Storage section click Cookies then http://fantasy.espn.com.
From there you should be able to find your swid and espn_s2 variables and values!
```python
from ff_espn_api import League
league_id = 1234
year = 2018
swid = '{03JFJHW-FWFWF-044G}'
espn_s2 = 'ASCWDWheghjwwqfwjqhgjkjgegkje'
league = League(league_id, year, espn_s2, swid)
```
